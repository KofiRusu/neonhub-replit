   - Database query performance
   - Error rates & circuit breaker events
   - Learning feedback loops observable

✅ Development Framework
   - Standardized patterns (service → router → tests)
   - Testing requirements explicit (unit/integration/E2E)
   - Learning loop integration mandatory
   - Code templates provided
   - Success criteria defined

KEY CAPABILITIES UNLOCKED
================================================================================

✅ Autonomous Agent Learning
   Agents now improve through use - they recall and apply learned patterns
   from past executions to inform future decisions.

✅ Production Visibility
   Complete observability stack deployed - response times, error rates,
   agent performance, and learning metrics all tracked and exportable.

✅ Rapid Feature Development
   Clear patterns, templates, and standards eliminate decision-making.
   Developers follow checklist to deploy new features consistently.

✅ Confident Testing
   Coverage targets explicit, test examples provided, standards enforced.
   All new code automatically covered by learning loop for feedback.

================================================================================
