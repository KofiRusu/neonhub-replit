Phase1: SDK ships dist bundles (core/sdk/dist/index.js:1) and tests (core/sdk/src/__tests__/client.test.ts:1) but cannot execute. Phase2: tRPC router defined (apps/api/src/trpc/router.ts:1) yet not mounted in Express (apps/api/src/server.ts:71). Phase3: Dashboard queries live adapters (apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:1, apps/web/src/lib/adapters/trends.ts:1) but requires backend to serve data. Phase4: Allocation engine implemented (apps/api/src/services/budgeting/allocation-engine.ts:1) while history remains TODO (apps/api/src/services/budgeting/index.ts:46). Phase5: Stripe webhook stub lacks signature + ledger writes (apps/api/src/routes/stripe-webhook.ts:1). Phase6: Subscription models exist (apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma:1419) but team invites stay in memory without RBAC (apps/api/src/routes/team.ts:40).
