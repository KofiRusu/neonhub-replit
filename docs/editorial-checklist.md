# Editorial SEO Checklist

Use this checklist before publishing any long-form article or landing page to ensure it aligns with NeonHub's SEO, compliance, and quality standards.

## Strategy & Targeting
- [ ] Confirm the primary keyword and intent (informational, transactional, navigational) from the keyword backlog.
- [ ] Reference the target persona and stage of the customer journey in the brief.
- [ ] Add supporting secondary keywords and related questions for internal linking.

## Content Quality
- [ ] Ensure the draft answers the search intent completely and adds original insight or data.
- [ ] Run the copy through the plagiarism checker and document the report ID in the PR or CMS entry.
- [ ] Validate tone, style, and brand voice alignment using the brand voice guardrails.
- [ ] Include clear calls-to-action and next steps that match the intent.

## On-Page Optimisation
- [ ] Craft a unique title tag (&lt;60 characters) with the primary keyword near the beginning.
- [ ] Write a compelling meta description (120–155 characters) with the primary keyword and a CTA.
- [ ] Verify a single H1, descriptive H2/H3 headings, and semantic HTML for lists and tables.
- [ ] Add descriptive alt text for all imagery and captions for charts or embeds.
- [ ] Insert internal links to at least two relevant evergreen resources and one conversion page.
- [ ] Include external citations for statistics, quotes, or studies.

## Technical Enhancements
- [ ] Embed Article JSON-LD using the structured data helper with accurate publish/modified dates.
- [ ] Confirm the canonical URL matches the intended destination environment.
- [ ] Optimise assets (WebP images, lazy loading for media, remove unused scripts/styles).
- [ ] Test the page with Lighthouse (mobile) and meet Core Web Vitals thresholds (LCP &lt; 2.5s, CLS &lt; 0.1, INP &lt; 200ms).

## Compliance & Accessibility
- [ ] Verify cookie banner behaviour and consent tracking for analytics on the page.
- [ ] Ensure the content meets accessibility guidelines (WCAG colour contrast, aria labels, keyboard focus).
- [ ] Check for personally identifiable information and redact or anonymise if present.
- [ ] Record legal approvals or disclaimers where required (finance, healthcare, etc.).

Document completion status in the publishing task, attach supporting assets (Lighthouse report, plagiarism report), and obtain final sign-off from the content lead.
