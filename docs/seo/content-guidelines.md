# NeonHub SEO Content Guidelines

## Tone & Voice
- Authoritative yet approachable; highlight practical takeaways for growth and operations leaders.
- Use active voice, short paragraphs (< 4 sentences), and descriptive subheadings.
- Incorporate NeonHub terminology (e.g., “orchestrations”, “adaptive agents”) where relevant.

## Structure Checklist
- [ ] One H1 per page mirroring the core topic/keyword.
- [ ] Use H2/H3 to segment sections aligned with search intent.
- [ ] Include TL;DR or summary for long-form posts.
- [ ] Add call-to-action blocks tailored to buyer stage (awareness, consideration, decision).
- [ ] Embed FAQs or snippets ideal for featured snippets when intent is informational.

## E‑E‑A‑T Enhancers
- Add author bios with credentials and LinkedIn links.
- Cite primary research, customer stories, and product data where available.
- Link to relevant documentation or demos to demonstrate expertise.
- Include last-reviewed date; schedule refresh cadence (default: 6 months).

## Keyword Usage
- Map each piece to a primary keyword from `docs/seo/keyword-map-template.csv`.
- Naturally weave secondary keywords into headings, bullets, and alt text.
- Avoid keyword stuffing; maintain readability scores (Hemingway/Yoast equivalent ≤ grade 8).

## Visual & Accessibility Standards
- Provide descriptive alt text (< 125 characters) for images.
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA; avoid text-heavy images without captions.
- Optimise media file names with hyphenated keywords (e.g., `workflow-automation-dashboard.png`).
