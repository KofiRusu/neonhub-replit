## ⚠️ NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

### Prisma WASM Location
**Note:** Prisma WASM file path check showed "not found" in standard location, but Prisma Client is fully functional and was successfully generated. The WASM may be in a different pnpm virtual store location.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Prisma Client import: SUCCESS
- ✅ Prisma Client instantiation: SUCCESS
- ✅ Prisma generate command: COMPLETED
- ✅ Functional test: PASSED

**Conclusion:** Prisma is working correctly despite path check anomaly. This is likely due to pnpm's virtual store structure.

### Disk Space
**Observation:** Started at 99% full (119MB free), cleared to 91% full (1.1GB free) by clearing caches.

**Status:** ✅ Sufficient space for all operations

### ESLint Configurations
**Note:** Some workspace packages lack ESLint configs (pre-existing issue, not related to our fix).

**Status:** ✅ Not blocking, can be addressed separately
