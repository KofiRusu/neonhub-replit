- ✅ Competitive differentiation if successful

**Cons:**
- ❌ Massive investment required
- ❌ Multi-year timeline unacceptable
- ❌ High execution risk
- ❌ Resource intensive

### 4.2 Option B: Remove Features Entirely (10 minutes)

**Investment:** $0  
**Risk Level:** LOW

**Scope:** Rebuild 2-3 core agents properly over 6-12 months

**Timeline:** 6-12 months  
**Investment:** $430K-$700K (conservative: $680K-$900K with contingency)
