## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Why the delays on agents?

After comprehensive validation, we discovered our AI Agents needed additional development to meet our quality standards. Rather than deploying features with limitations, we chose to rebuild them properly with real integrations and proven capabilities. We believe this is the right decision for our customers.

### Can I use agents now?

Our **Ad Copy Generation** is fully functional and production-ready. Other agent capabilities are in active development. You can join our beta program to get early access as features become ready.

### When will my favorite agent be ready?

Check the timeline above for target release dates. We update this monthly with honest progress reports. [Subscribe for updates →](link)

### What if timelines change?

We'll communicate immediately if any timeline changes. We build in buffer time to our estimates, but development is complex. Transparency is our priority.

[Join our beta program →](link). Beta participants get early access, direct feedback channels with our product team, and influence on the roadmap.

### Can I vote on feature priority?

Yes! [Visit our feature voting board →](link) to vote on what we should build next.
