### Action 5: REMOVE NON-FUNCTIONAL UI COMPONENTS ⚠️

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Owner:** VP Engineering / Engineering Lead  
**Timeline:** Day 2-5  
**Status:** 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED

#### Affected UI Components:

**High Priority - Remove/Disable Immediately:**

1. **Agent Dashboard Page** (`apps/web/src/app/agents/page.tsx`)
   - Displays mock agents with fake performance metrics
   - Shows capabilities that don't exist
   - **Action:** Add "Beta - In Development" banner OR redirect to roadmap

2. **SEO Agent UI** (if exists in production)
   - Displays hardcoded score of 78
   - Shows fake recommendations
   - **Action:** Disable or add "Demo Only" warning

3. **Trend Analysis UI** (`apps/web/src/app/trends/page.tsx`)
   - Shows hardcoded trends to all users
   - No real data backing insights
   - **Action:** Disable or convert to "Coming Soon" placeholder

4. **Campaign Agent Full Features**
   - Platform integration UI (non-functional)
   - Real-time monitoring (doesn't fetch data)
   - **Action:** Keep ad copy generation, disable non-functional features

#### Implementation Plan:

**Option A: Feature Flags (Recommended)**
```typescript
// Add to environment config
FEATURE_FLAG_AGENTS_ENABLED=false
FEATURE_FLAG_SEO_AGENT_ENABLED=false
FEATURE_FLAG_TREND_AGENT_ENABLED=false
FEATURE_FLAG_CAMPAIGN_AGENT_FULL=false
FEATURE_FLAG_CAMPAIGN_AGENT_COPY_GEN=true
```

**Option B: UI Banners (Transparent Approach)**
```tsx
// Add to affected pages
<AlertBanner variant="warning">
  ⚠️ This feature is currently in beta development. 
  Insights shown are for demonstration purposes. 
  <Link href="/roadmap">See development roadmap →</Link>
</AlertBanner>
```

**Option C: Disable & Redirect**
```typescript
// Redirect agent pages to roadmap
if (!user.hasEarlyAccess && !FEATURE_FLAG_AGENTS_ENABLED) {
  redirect('/roadmap')
}
```

#### Files Requiring Modification:

| File Path | Action | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `apps/web/src/app/agents/page.tsx` | Add beta banner or disable | HIGH |
| `apps/web/src/app/trends/page.tsx` | Disable or add warning | HIGH |
| `apps/web/src/app/campaigns/page.tsx` | Disable non-functional features | MEDIUM |
| `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` | Remove agent status cards showing mock data | MEDIUM |
| `apps/web/components/agent-card.tsx` | Add status badges for beta features | MEDIUM |
| `apps/web/src/components/navigation.tsx` | Update nav to indicate beta status | LOW |
| `README_AGENTS.md` | Update documentation to reflect current state | LOW |

#### Recommended Approach:

**Phased UI Update:**

**Phase 1 (Day 2-3): Immediate Warning**
- Add prominent beta warnings to all agent pages
- Display "Current Status" indicator
- Link to transparent roadmap

**Phase 2 (Day 4-5): Feature Flagging**
- Implement feature flags for all agent capabilities
- Disable non-functional features
- Keep working features (ad copy generation) enabled

**Phase 3 (Week 2): Transparency Dashboard**
- Create `/roadmap` page showing:
  - Current capability status
  - Development timeline
  - Which features actually work
  - Expected delivery dates

#### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Feature flags implemented
- [ ] Agent pages updated with warnings
- [ ] Non-functional features disabled
- [ ] Working features clearly labeled
- [ ] Navigation updated
- [ ] Documentation reflects current state
- [ ] QA tested in staging
