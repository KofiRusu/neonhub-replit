## 7. CAPACITY PLANNING

### 7.1 Weekly Capacity Calculation

```
Total Capacity (Story Points) = Team Size × Days per Sprint × Points per Day

Where:
- Team Size = Number of engineers
- Days per Sprint = 10 (2-week sprint)
- Points per Day = 0.7 (accounting for meetings, context switching)

Example:
12 engineers × 10 days × 0.7 = 84 theoretical points
Adjusted for meetings/overhead (20%) = 67 available points
Sprint commitment = 67 × 0.85 (buffer) = ~57 points
```

### 7.2 Capacity by Phase

| Phase | Team Size | Available Points/Sprint | Target Velocity |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Phase 0** | 8 → 12 | 45 → 67 | 35-50 |
| **Phase 1** | 12 → 14 | 67 → 78 | 50-60 |
| **Phase 2** | 14 → 15 | 78 → 84 | 60-70 |
| **Phase 3** | 15 | 84 | 65-75 |
| **Phase 4** | 15 | 84 | 65-75 |
| **Phase 5** | 15 → 12 | 84 → 67 | 60-70 |

### 7.3 Capacity Adjustments

**Account for:**
- **Holidays:** US holidays, team PTO
- **Onboarding:** New hires at 50% capacity first 2 weeks
- **Training:** 5% capacity reserved for learning
- **Tech Debt:** 10% capacity for refactoring
- **Meetings:** ~20% of time (standups, planning, reviews)
- **Unplanned Work:** 10% buffer for bugs, incidents

**Effective Capacity:**
- Theoretical: 100%
- After adjustments: ~70-75%
- Sprint commitment: 85% of available (leave buffer)
