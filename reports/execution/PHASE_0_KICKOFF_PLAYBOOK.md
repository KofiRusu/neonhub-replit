File: `docs/VALIDATION_SOP.md`

```markdown
# Validation Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview
Every feature and component must pass validation before deployment.

## Validation Levels

### Level 1: Unit Validation
- Scope: Individual functions/methods
- Criteria: Accuracy, error handling, edge cases
- Owner: Developer
- Timeline: During development

### Level 2: Integration Validation
- Scope: Component interactions
- Criteria: Data flow, API contracts, dependencies
- Owner: QA Engineer
- Timeline: Before staging deployment

### Level 3: System Validation
- Scope: End-to-end functionality
- Criteria: User workflows, performance, reliability
- Owner: Validation Lead
- Timeline: Before production

### Level 4: Production Validation
- Scope: Live environment monitoring
- Criteria: Real-world performance, user satisfaction
- Owner: Product Team
- Timeline: Continuous post-deployment

## Validation Workflow

1. Developer completes feature
2. Developer runs Level 1 validation (automated)
3. PR created with validation report attached
4. Code review (includes validation review)
5. Merge to staging triggers Level 2 validation
6. QA performs Level 3 validation
7. Validation Lead approves or requests changes
8. Pass validation gate → Production deployment
9. Level 4 monitoring begins immediately

## Validation Report Template

[See VALIDATION_GATE_CHECKLIST.md for details]

## Failure Procedures

If validation fails:
1. Create bug ticket (P0 if blocking release)
2. Assign to original developer
3. Root cause analysis required
4. Fix, re-validate, document learnings
5. Update validation criteria if needed
```

**3:00 - 5:00: Metrics & Reporting Setup**

**Define Phase 0 KPIs:**

| Metric | Target | Measurement | Reporting |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Team Hiring | 100% critical roles | Headcount | Daily |
| Sprint Velocity | 20-30 pts/sprint | JIRA | Bi-weekly |
| Code Coverage | 90%+ | Jest/Pytest | Daily |
| Validation Pass Rate | 100% for deployment | Validation reports | Per validation |
| Infrastructure Uptime | 99.5%+ | Datadog | Real-time |
| Deployment Frequency | 2x/week to staging | Git tags | Weekly |

**Setup KPI Dashboard:**
- [ ] Grafana/Datadog dashboard created
- [ ] Metrics auto-updating
- [ ] Alerts configured for thresholds
- [ ] Shareable link for stakeholders

#### Day 4 Deliverables

export abstract class BaseValidator {
  abstract validate(input: any, expected: any): ValidationResult;
  
  protected createResult(
    passed: boolean,
    metrics: ValidationMetrics,
    details: string[]
  ): ValidationResult {
    return {
      passed,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      metrics,
      details,
      validator: this.constructor.name
    };
  }
}

// src/validators/AccuracyValidator.ts
export class AccuracyValidator extends BaseValidator {
  constructor(private threshold: number = 0.90) {
    super();
  }
  
  validate(predictions: any[], groundTruth: any[]): ValidationResult {
    const accuracy = this.calculateAccuracy(predictions, groundTruth);
    const passed = accuracy >= this.threshold;
    
    return this.createResult(
      passed,
      { accuracy, threshold: this.threshold },
      [`Accuracy: ${accuracy.toFixed(2)}`, `Threshold: ${this.threshold}`]
    );
  }
  
  private calculateAccuracy(predictions: any[], groundTruth: any[]): number {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

2. **Validation Runner**
```typescript

export class ValidationRunner {
  constructor(private validators: BaseValidator[]) {}
  
  async runValidation(component: string, testData: TestData): Promise<ValidationReport> {
    const results: ValidationResult[] = [];
    
    for (const validator of this.validators) {
      const result = await validator.validate(
        testData.predictions,
        testData.groundTruth
      );
      results.push(result);
    }

      component,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      overallStatus: allPassed ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED',
      results,
      summary: this.createSummary(results)
    };
  }
}
```

3. **Pilot Validation Example**
```typescript
// examples/seo-title-validation.ts
import { ValidationRunner, AccuracyValidator, PerformanceValidator } from '../src';

async function validateSEOTitleGeneration() {
  // Test data
  const testCases = [
    { input: "blog post about AI", expected: "Ultimate Guide to AI: Everything You Need to Know" },
    // ... more test cases
  ];
  
  // Configure validators
  const validators = [
    new AccuracyValidator(0.90), // 90% accuracy required
    new PerformanceValidator({ maxLatency: 500 }) // 500ms max
  ];
  
  // Run validation
  const runner = new ValidationRunner(validators);
  const report = await runner.runValidation('SEO Title Generator', testCases);
  
  console.log(report);
  
  if (report.overallStatus === 'PASSED') {
    console.log('✓ Validation PASSED - Component ready for deployment');
  } else {
    console.log('✗ Validation FAILED - Component needs improvement');
  }
}

validateSEOTitleGeneration();
